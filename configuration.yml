# DESCRIPTION
#
# HP_CHAIN  The chain representing the protein to predict.
#
# CYCLES           Number of cycles of the optimization algorithms.
# N_ANTS           Number of ants in the ant colony
# ACO_ALPHA        Parameter 'alpha' of the ACO algorithm, which represents the weight of the pheromones in each ant's decision
# ACO_BETA         Parameter 'beta' of the ACO algorithm, which represents the weight of the heuristic values on ant's decision
# ACO_EVAPORATION  Evaporation rate of the pheromones in the pheromone matrix.
#                    At each iteration, pheromones are multiplied by (1-p), where p is this parameter.
#
# RANDOM_SEED    seed for the random number generator. If negative, seed is chosen randomly.
#
# STRUCTURE_FILENAME  name of the file where to output the structure information of the protein predicted.
